Additionally, you’ll explore API security with ASP.NET Core identity and authorization policies, and write reliable unit tests using both .NET Core and React before you deploy your app to the Azure cloud.\",\r\n        \"cover\": \"https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789537611/cover/9781789537611-original.png\",\r\n        \"quantity\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"id\": \"14\",\r\n        \"title\": \"Web Development with Node and Express: Leveraging the JavaScript Stack\",\r\n        \"author\": \"Ethan Brown\",\r\n        \"year\": \"2014\",\r\n        \"language\": \"English\",\r\n        \"pages\": \"360\",\r\n        \"price\": 1200,\r\n        \"description\": \"Learn how to build dynamic web applications with Express, a key component of the Node/JavaScript development stack.

The first part shows you how to start crafting composable UIs using React, from rendering with JSX and creating reusable components through to routing and creating isomorphic applications that run on Node. We then move on to showing you how to take the concepts of React and apply them to building Native UIs using React Native. You'll find out how to build responsive and streamlined UIs that can properly handle user interactions in a mobile environment. You'll also learn how to access device-specific APIs such as the geolocation API, and how to handle offline development with React Native. Finally, we'll tie all of these skills together and shows you how you can create React applications that run on every major platform. As well as understanding application state in depth, you'll learn how to leverage Relay to make feature-complete, data-driven web and native mobile applications.\",\r\n        \"cover\": \"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qchBpytTL.jpg\",\r\n        \"quantity\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"id\": \"16\",\r\n        \"title\": \"Object-Oriented JavaScript\",\r\n        \"author\": \"Kumar Chetan Sharma and Stoyan Stefanov\",\r\n        \"year\": \"2013\",\r\n        \"language\": \"English\",\r\n        \"pages\": \"578\",\r\n        \"price\": 2147,\r\n        \"description\": \"You will first be introduced to object-oriented programming, then to the basics of objects in JavaScript.
